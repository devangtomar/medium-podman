**Podman (An alternative to Docker !?!) 🦭**

What is Podman? 🤔

Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool for finding, running, building, sharing, and deploying applications that use Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images.

It operates very similar to Docker and is simple to set up.

Containers can run as root or in a rootless manner.
